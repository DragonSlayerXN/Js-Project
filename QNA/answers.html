    <p> 1. let greeting1 = 'Hi', greeting2 = 'Hello', greeting3 = 'Konichiwa';

            let greeting1 = 'Hi';
            let greeting2 = 'Hello';
            let greeting3 = 'Konichiwa';

            let greeting1;
            let greeting2;
            let greeting3;

            greeting1 = 'Hi';
            greeting2 = 'Hello';
            greeting3 ='Konichiwa';

        2. let greeting1 = 'Hi', greeting2 = 'Hello', greeting3 = 'Konichiwa';

        3.The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _
            The first character must not be a digit. 
            Use human-readable names like userName or shoppingCart.
            Stay away from abbreviations or short names like a, b, c, unless you really know what you’re doing.
             Make names maximally descriptive and concise. Examples of bad names are data and value. Such names say nothing. It’s only okay to use them if the context of the code makes it exceptionally obvious which data or value the variable is referencing.
            Agree on terms within your team and in your own mind. If a site visitor is called a “user” then we should name related variables currentUser or newUser instead of currentVisitor or newManInTown.

        4. values should not have quotes "" otherwise it will join the 2 strings rather than add two integers.
        5. remainder or modulo gives us the remainder of a divsion eg. 21%10 = 1 (10 goes into 21 two times with a remainder of 1 )
        6. == is equals  and === is equals without type conversion.
        7. when you get a value that cannot be computed, eg string conversion to numeric value 
        8. let value = i;
            i++ (increment)
            i-- (decrement)

        9. Postfix the expression is evaluated first then value is incremented or decremented, prefix the value is chanegd before the expression is evaluated.
        10. Bodmass ?
        11. console.log(variable);
        12. fastest way to convert to a number ?
        13.String.
        Number.
        Boolean.
        Null.
        Undefined.
        Symbol.
        BigInt.
        Object.

        14.Object as it is not predefined 
        15. Null is an empty placeholder while Undefined is a space that has been assigned any value 
        16. no difference for '', "" and back ticks
        17. string interpolation 
        18. 
        19. ${}
        20. \
        21. slice() extracts parts of a string and returns the extracted parts in a new string.
         
        substr() extracts parts of a string, beginning at the character at the specified position, and returns the specified number of characters

        22.1-Evaluates operands from left to right. 
        2-For each operand converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand. 
        3-If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand

        23.Comparison operators — operators that compare values and return true or false . The operators include: > , < , >= , <= , === , and !== . 
        Logical operators — operators that combine multiple boolean expressions or values and provide a single boolean output

        24.Truthy values are values that evaluate to True in a boolean context. 
        Falsy values are values that evaluate to False in a boolean context

        25.JavaScript: undefined , null , NaN , 0 , "" (empty string), and false
        26. control behavior in JavaScript and determine whether or not pieces of code can run. 
        27. if (1 == 2)
        {
                console.log('Gasp')
        }
        else {
            console.log('ofcourse not ')
        }
        28. Switch (1!==2)
        {
        case a :
            answer = 'Yes';
            break;

        case b:
        answer = 'Gasp';
            break;

            default:
            answer = null ;
        return;
        }
        29. a condition followed by a question mark ( ? )
        then an expression to execute if the condition is truthy followed by a colon ( : )
        and finally the expression to execute if the condition is falsy.
        30.Nesting is when you write something inside of something else. You can have a function inside of another function
        31.a “chunk” of code that you can use over and over again, rather than writing it out multiple times.
        32. by calling the function like so mynewfunction();
        33.An anonymous function is a function without a name eg function ();
        34.When a variable is declared inside a function, it is only accessible within that function and cannot be used outside that function.
        35.a value that a function returns to the calling script or function when it completes its task
        36.a new way to write anonymous function expressions.
